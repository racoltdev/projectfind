projectreplace\n
Replaces all instances of a phrase in a project with some other string.\n
projectreplace is built off of projectfind. All arguments and examples here are similarly mirrored in projectfind.\n
\n
Usage: %s [keyphrase] [replace phrase] [arguments]\n
\t%s expects a keyphrase, the string to replace it with, followed by any additional arguments.\n
\n
Arguments:\n
\t-h, --help\n\t\tDisplay this manual.\n
\t-d <val>, --depth <val>\n\t\tThe number of directories deep a search should go. Default is 2.\n
\t-e <val>, --exclude <val>\n\t\tAny file or directory glob that should be excluded from search.\n
\t-i, --ignorecase\n\t\tCase agnostic search.\n
\t-p, --partial\n\t\tMatch and replace keyphrase even if it is a part of another word.\n
\t-r <filename>, --exclusionrules <filename>\n\t\tTakes a file containing a newline separated list as argument. Any files or directories matched by globs in the list are excluded from the search. Useful if you search a project a lot or have some common system wide paths you exclude often.\n
